# RAG Knowledge Base Verification

> [!TIP] Instructions
> 1. Keep the `lecture_agent_daemon.py` running in your terminal.

I need to verify if you can access the local knowledge base (RAG).

**My Query:** Explain the concept of **[INSERT TOPIC HERE]**.

**Constraint for this test:**
1. First, explicitly list the **Source Documents** you found in the local database regarding this topic. Format it as:
   * **Found Context 1**: [Source Filename] - [Brief Quote]
   * **Found Context 2**: ...
2. If you find NO context in the local database, explicitly state: "❌ No local context found."
3. Then, provide a short summary of the concept based *only* on those materials.
